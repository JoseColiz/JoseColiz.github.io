                    UFC is currently my favorite promotion to watch. UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) was established to see which fighting style 
                    <br>was the best. It included boxing, wrestling, karate, judo, jiu-jitsu, etc. Sometimes, people tend to think it can be boring because, 
                    <br> of the ground game but, for me, it is exciting to watch the more technical fighters go at it and see how they analyze each scenario.

                    Boxing, nicknamed the sweet science, is something I really enjoy watching. Personally I have always wanted to try train in a boxing
                    <br> gym. The sport is the most natural fighting style, two men throwing punches at each other trying to make their way to a championship.
                    <br> A few of my favorite fighters at the moment have to be Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, Vasyl Lomachenko, and Mikey Garcia. All are experts 
                    <br> in their craft.

                    <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; ">Bellator</h2>
                   Bellator is another MMA organization just like the UFC. Bellator is often considerd the nearest competition to the UFC. Here they tend<br>
                     to have the next level of fighters. Fighters tend to sign with Bellator when they are young and trying to make a name for themselves or<br>
                      have been released from the UFC or other orgs. The fights here tend to be more exciting, which is why I love watching. Dillon Danis,<br>
                       Gegard Mousasi, Michael Page, and Michael Chandler are some of my current favorite fighters.
