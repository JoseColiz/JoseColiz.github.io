                    UFC is currently my favorite promotion to watch. UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) was established to see which fighting style 
                    <br>was the best. It included boxing, wrestling, karate, judo, jiu-jitsu, etc. Sometimes, people tend to think it can be boring because, 
                    <br> of the ground game but, for me, it is exciting to watch the more technical fighters go at it and see how they analyze each scenario.

                    Boxing, nicknamed the sweet science, is something I really enjoy watching. Personally I have always wanted to try train in a boxing
                    <br> gym. The sport is the most natural fighting style, two men throwing punches at each other trying to make their way to a championship.

                    Currently, this is my favorite game that is available. When I have free time away from school work or there are no sports games on tv, 
                    <br> then I will spend my time playing the game.
