            <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; ">Fifa 19</h2>
            Currently, this is my favorite game that is available. When I have free time away from school work or there are no sports games on tv, 
            <br> then I will spend my time playing the game. The Fifa series has been one of my favorite franchises in for a while now. There are 
            <br> several game modes that I enjoy playing. Pro Clubs is one where you make your own player and get to make him better after playing
             in <br>games. You make a team with friends and try to go through the ranks together and get as high as you can. Another mode is Ultimate Team. 
            <br> in this mode you collect player cards and form your "dream team" to compete with players from all over the world.<br>

            <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; ">Apex: Legends</h2>
            This is the other game that I play when I get tired of Fifa. Apex is a free-to-play FPS (first person shooter) battle royale game. 60 players 
            <br>are in a game together in teams of three. The teams roam around the map collecing their wepons and material and try to eliminate the 
            <br> other teams and become the champions. The game was one of the most popular games upon its release and had 2.5 million players within
            <br> the first day, 25 million players in the first week, and reached 50 million one month after release. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5GD_6htAQ0" target="_blank">Here is the gameplay trailer</a>
