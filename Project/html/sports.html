                   Manchester United is my favorite soccer/football (whatever you want to call it) team. I have supported this team for years now. 
                   <br>Their history, the legends that have played for the club, the colors, Old Trafford, all led me to this team.
                    My favorite player of all time,<br> Cristiano Ronaldo, started to grow into the legend he is in Manchester. The treble winning 1998-99 team, although I did not get to 
                   <br>watch them play, is one of my favorite teams ever, along with the Champions League winning team in 2007-08. </p>

                    My favorite football team is the Chicago Bears. I have been watching this team and following them ever since I was a kid. <br>
                    Currently the team is on the rise after many years of being very bad. Last season the team was finally able to make it to <br>
                    the playoffs for the first time in years. With players like Mitch Trubisky, Tarik Cohen, Khalil Mack, and Eddie Jackson, myself <br>
                    and all of the other fans have something exciting to root for and watch on sundays.
