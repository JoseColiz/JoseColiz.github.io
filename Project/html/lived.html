            <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 18px">Chicago is the town that I was born in and lived in for the first<br>
            three years of my life. My family and I had to move away from the city<br>
            because of work. if there was no need to leave beacuse of the location of<br>
            work, there is a very good chance that Chicago would still be my home.</p>

                After leaving <br>Chicago my family purchased an empty lot in Dekalb and had to<br>
            move in with family for a couple of months while the house was built. </p>

        <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 18px">Dekalb is my current home. I have lived here for the past 18 years of my life. Living here made<br>
            the choice of attending NIU an easy choice. I attended every year of school in Dekalb, all the way from pre-k<br>
            until now when I am going to graduate from NIU.
