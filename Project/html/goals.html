            <h2>Five year goals</h2>
            Within the next five years in my life and my career, there are a few things that I want to accomplish. As boring as it may sound,
            <br> I just hope to be at a company that will value me. I would like to be somewhere that lets me use what I learned in school and
            <br> apply it there. In terms of personal goals, I would love to be close to or have purchased a new home in the city I am working in. 
            <br> Another personal goal is to be able to have visited England, Manchester in particular, Spain, Germany, and possibly France
            <br> and go and watch soccer games in those countries.

            <h2>Ten year goals</h2>
            In 10 years I hope to be at the company and have been promoted to a senior or management position. I would love to be able have a role
            <br> in the company that would allow me to mentor new hires and be able to help the other employees. Something that I would love to 
            <br> finish as a personal goal and possibly he helpful for a career goal would be to get my masters degree. This is something that I have
            <br> been thinking about for quite some time, and I would like to think I have done so in 10 years.
