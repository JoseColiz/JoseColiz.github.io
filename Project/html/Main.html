       </div>
       <p style="text-align:center">I am currently a senior at NIU majoring in Information Systems with a minor in 
       <br> data analytics with a certificate in analytics using SAS software. I have gained 
       <br> experience in many different softwares in SAS including visual analytics, SAS 
       <br> studio, Tableau, and others which in time should help with whatever job I get. 
       <br> I hope to be able to work as some sort of business analyst where I will actually
       <br> get a chance to make an impact in a company and not just be another employee.</p>
